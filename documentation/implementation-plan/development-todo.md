## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Risk: Difficulty implementing complex features like the Companion Pod system
   - Mitigation: Allocate extra resources for complex features, create simplified versions first

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Adding unplanned features that extend the project
   - Mitigation: Maintain a strict feature freeze after Phase 4, create a backlog for post-release features

3. **Asset Creation Delays**
   - Risk: Delays in creating or acquiring game assets
   - Mitigation: Use placeholder assets during development, parallelize asset creation with coding

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Game performance problems on target platforms
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing throughout development, early optimization of critical systems

5. **Integration Problems**
   - Risk: Difficulties when integrating multiple game systems
   - Mitigation: Implement integration tests, create clear interfaces between systems

## Implementation Notes

## Adjustment Strategy

The implementation plan is designed to be flexible. If challenges occur:

1. Evaluate the impact on the critical path
2. Adjust scope if necessary (identify "nice-to-have" vs. "must-have" features)
3. Re-allocate resources to focus on blocking issues
4. Update the plan with revised priorities

Progress will be tracked against milestones, with adjustments made as needed to ensure the project stays on track for completion.
